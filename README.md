# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Image-Text-Data
## Overview

the aim of this project to build a  sentiment analysis system that integrates and analyzes both text and image data to predict sentiment accurately. This project challenges us to work  advanced techniques to design, train, and evaluate data .

## Objective

The primary goal is to develop and train two models capable of extracting sentiment signals from both text and images:

1. The first model interprets images and extracts sentiment.
2. The second model interprets text and extracts sentiment.

## Deliverables

1. **Model Files:**
   - Trained model weights or saved models for future inference.

2. **Evaluation Results:**
   - A confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall and  F1-score
## Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing

#### Text Data:
- Perform normalization (lowercase text, remove punctuation, stemming or lemmatization, and remove stop words).
- Tokenize text data and convert it to numerical vectors using Word2Vec.

#### Image Data:
- Resize images to a fixed size for consistency.
- Normalize pixel values to standardize input data.
- Consider data augmentation techniques (e.g., flipping, rotating) to increase model robustness.

### 2. Model Architecture
- Design a CNN model to handle images.
- Design an RNN model (using LSTM and GRUs) to handle text data.

## Conclusion

This capstone project provides an excellent opportunity to delve into  sentiment analysis, allowing us to understand the text and image data in predicting sentiment. The techniques and models developed here can be applied to various real-world scenarios.
